We understand set-up fees, personal guarantees and long contracts are needless barriers to prospective agencies, which is why Sonovate does not require any of these.<br /> <br /> <b>Cashflow</b><br /> As your contract business grows, so will the pressure on your businessâ€™s cashflow and its potential problems. We alleviate the pressure by releasing 100;% of your profit the week after a timesheet is approved, paying contractors on your behalf, and securing the money from your clients.<br /> <br /> <b>Technology Eliminating Contract Administration</b><br /> As a business that has traditionally supplied permanent or executive search services, the prospect of running contractors can be daunting from an administrative point of view. Using Sonovate means you don't need to worry about back-office related headaches. Included in our offering: Flexible finance, credit control, online timesheets, invoicing, candidate payroll and a cloud based portal to monitor your contract business.<br /> <br /> I have attached the following documents which explain:<br /> <br /> - How Sonovate works<br /> - How Sonovate compares to other providers<br /> <br /> Also have a look at our website which has more detail - www.sonovate.com<br /> <br /> Please feel free to email or call if you have any questions.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />");
